# Christi Mahu - Professional Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my professional portfolio, available to view at [**christimahu.dev**](https://christimahu.dev).

## About This Project

This is a simple, static promotional site built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and a touch of JavaScript for animations. The goal was to create a fast, responsive, and visually appealing showcase of my work and experience in MLOps, GenAI infrastructure, and systems engineering.

While the code for this site is straightforward, the projects it highlights are not. I encourage you to explore my other repositories to see more in-depth examples of my work with Rust, Go, C++, and various AI/ML technologies.

Thank you for visiting.
