This interactive 3D graph demonstrates the concept of how a sentence, understood by humans through the association of words, can be deconstructed by an AI into a relational map of tokens. It's a conceptual look into how machines "see" language, finding patterns in token relationships in a way that is analogous to how humans find meaning in words.</p>

Especially useful in consulting contexts, it isolates tooling per project, avoiding version conflicts across diverse client stacks. At its core is Ubuntu on Docker. Before the rise of containers, earlier versions ran on VMs like Vagrant and VirtualBox — even on a Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster. Orchestration is implemented 100% in Rust, emphasizing reproducible, Linux-native workflows. DevRS includes preinstalled toolchains, Google Cloud SDK, shell utilities, and a NeoVim setup optimized for cloud development and systems programming.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">As Senior Director of Platform Engineering, Christi designed and implemented a distributed edge computing platform for real-time IoT data replication across millions of devices, creating the foundation for edge ML inference and real-time analytics at global scale. She architected the serverless infrastructure and Terraform IaC patterns that enabled a two-pizza team to replace a legacy platform previously maintained by 50+ engineers, reducing infrastructure costs by 50% while supporting petabyte-scale workloads. A key component of this platform was a novel Linux agent deployed on IoT and Edge devices. Christi took technical ownership and refactored it from Go to Rust with full integration test coverage, leveraging Rust’s built-in testing framework to ensure reliability. This transition improved performance, memory safety, and concurrency while making the agent production-ready through test-driven development (TDD). The agent supported over-the-air embedded system upgrades and real-time data transfers, enabling fault-tolerant synchronization between distributed devices and serverless cloud functions. This Rust implementation utilized Tokio for async networking, Serde for serialization, and was optimized for cross-compilation to embedded environments.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">As a Principal Architect at McKinsey & Company, Christi built an Azure data and ML infrastructure accelerator using Terraform-managed resources (Data Factory, Data Lake Gen2, Databricks, Purview), Snowflake, and Python ETL frameworks, with a Backstage portal to streamline delivery. She led platform standardization initiatives consolidating fragmented data and ML engineering practices across the firm’s global delivery organization. Her team built a developer tool suite for data engineers and AI practitioners on Microsoft Azure. The accelerator provided Azure-native solutions integrating Purview for metadata governance, Azure Data Factory for pipeline orchestration, and Snowflake scaffolding scripts. It included sample ETL pipelines with Python-based transformation, validation, and filtering, plus an early-stage automated Databricks integration for scalable processing—enabling consistent client delivery across engagements. She also optimized a Kubernetes platform for a global financial client, migrating from legacy Jenkins to GitOps workflows with GitHub Actions and implementing blue/green deployments. This reversed critical delivery issues and achieved sustained platform reliability, aligning with enterprise performance expectations.</p>

She leveraged Go Modules for dependency management, Cobra and Viper for CLI tooling, Gin for API development, and Testify to promote TDD and robust unit testing. She also architected gRPC-based microservices with Protobuf and implemented <a href="https://github.com/asobti/kube-monkey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link">Kube Monkey</a> for chaos engineering, automating pod termination to strengthen system reliability. As part of a multi-team initiative, Christi’s team was responsible for building the Kubernetes foundation for an AI startup in Life Sciences (acquired by Accenture), a collaboration with Google Cloud. Her team focused on Helm for deployment automation, Istio with Google Cloud Anthos for service mesh networking, BigQuery for cloud-scale data analytics, and GitLab for CI/CD pipelines, optimizing cloud-native operations.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">As a contributor to Mozilla’s <a href="https://aframe.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link">A-Frame</a>, Christi collaborated with the Mozilla XR team to develop the <a href="https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/components/gltf-model.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link">glTF component</a>, a streamlined alternative to the previously mainstream Collada format. Optimized for WebGL and real-time rendering, glTF significantly reduced file sizes, load times, and rendering overhead, making it the preferred format for 3D asset delivery in A-Frame. Working closely with the original creator of glTF, Christi implemented native support for the format, ensuring seamless integration with A-Frame’s entity-component system. Her work improved performance, compatibility, and accessibility for developers creating web-based VR and AR experiences.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">As the sole 3D developer at We Are Royale, Christi built the entire Unity-based codebase for the <a href="https://weareroyale.com/case-studies/pokemon-ar-vr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link">Pokémon AR/VR project</a>, developing a modular component system in C#. Using Unity’s prefab system, she created reusable MonoBehaviour scripts, custom ScriptableObjects, and editor extensions that allowed artists to integrate assets seamlessly. This project was a pitch and discovery-phase prototype, designed to showcase the studio’s capabilities in AR/VR development. Christi’s work included custom physics interactions, procedural animation controllers, and shader-driven visual effects to enhance real-time immersion. She also optimized scene management, object pooling, and asynchronous loading to ensure smooth performance across various hardware constraints.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold accent-color mb-3">Early Coding — From Chatbots to C++ Exploits</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">Christi’s journey in software began around 11 years old with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Pocket_Computer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link">TRS-80 Pocket Computer</a> handed down by her mother, an Electrical Engineer. Christi wrote her first programs in BASIC—starting with a chatbot as a virtual girlfriend, then gradually teaching it to become a study companion. By 13, she wrote a turn-based ASCII Space Invaders clone in Borland C++. Her curiosity about networking led her to explore system administration at her school, where she wrote a C++ program that quietly traveled across the network, collecting credentials along the way. Once every student’s login was gathered, it triggered a colorful ASCII message to a particular classmate: “Will you go out with me?” The message got her attention—but ironically, Christi’s social programming hadn’t advanced as far as her technical skills, and she was too frozen to respond. A year later, Christi and a friend discovered Linux and uncovered an unprotected password file at a local ISP. Using a specialized security tool, they cycled through various accounts, bypassing restrictions to obtain unlimited internet. These early experiments in automation, security, and system programming laid the foundation for a career spanning game development, cloud architecture, and AI-driven content analysis—bringing her adolescent dream of chatbots to reality.</p>
